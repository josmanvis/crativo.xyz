|---------|--------|
| Blog or articles section | Focus on project portfolio only; can add later if needed |
| User accounts/login | Static showcase site; no user-generated content |
| Content management system | Manual curation sufficient for v1; static site simpler |
| Multi-language support | English audience for initial launch |
| Project commenting or likes | Not an interactive social platform |
| Video hosting | Use external platforms (YouTube, Vimeo) for project demos |
| E-commerce or paid content | Portfolio showcase, not a storefront |
