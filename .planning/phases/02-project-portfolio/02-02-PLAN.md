<objective>
Build individual project detail pages with hero, description, tech stack, links, metrics, gallery, and code snippets.

Purpose: Detail pages are where visitors dive deep into individual work. Each page must feel rich and demonstrate the project's value through multiple content sections.
Output: Dynamic route at /projects/[id] rendering a full project page with all 7 required sections using placeholder content.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extend project data with detail fields and create detail components</name>
  <files>src/types/project.ts, src/data/projects.ts, src/components/ProjectHero.tsx, src/components/ProjectGallery.tsx, src/components/CodeSnippet.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Extend `src/types/project.ts` Project interface with detail fields:
    - longDescription: string (2-3 paragraphs)
    - links: { label: string; url: string; icon?: string }[] (GitHub, Live Demo, Docs)
    - gallery: string[] (placeholder image paths)
    - codeSnippet: { language: string; code: string; filename: string }

    Update `src/data/projects.ts` -- add the new fields to each of the 15 projects:
    - longDescription: 2-3 sentences of realistic placeholder copy per project
    - links: 2-3 links each (GitHub, Live Demo, Docs -- use "#" as href)
    - gallery: 3-4 placeholder paths each (will render as colored gradient divs)
    - codeSnippet: A short (5-10 line) realistic code snippet relevant to each project's tech stack (e.g., React component for an App, hook for a Library, shader for an Experiment)

    Create `src/components/ProjectHero.tsx`:
    - Accepts Project as prop
    - Full-width gradient banner (h-64, gradient based on category color)
    - Title (text-4xl font-bold), description below
    - Links row: rendered as styled anchor tags with subtle hover (text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300, underline)
    - Back button/link to "/" at top-left (text-gray-400 hover:text-white, "< Back")

    Create `src/components/ProjectGallery.tsx`:
    - Accepts gallery: string[] prop
    - Renders 2x2 grid of colored gradient placeholder divs (rounded-lg, aspect-video)
    - Each div has slightly different gradient angle/color to simulate different screenshots
    - Label "Gallery" as section heading (text-2xl font-semibold mb-4)

    Create `src/components/CodeSnippet.tsx`:
    - Accepts { language: string; code: string; filename: string }
    - Renders a dark code block (bg-gray-900 rounded-lg p-4 font-mono text-sm)
    - Header bar with filename (text-gray-400 text-xs) and language badge
    - Code rendered in a pre/code block with overflow-x-auto
    - No external syntax highlighting library needed -- use basic white text with opacity variations for a "code-like" appearance
  </action>
  <verify>`cd /Users/jose/Developer/crativo.xyz && npx tsc --noEmit` passes cleanly</verify>
  <done>Project type extended. All 15 projects have detail data. Hero, Gallery, and CodeSnippet components exist with proper types.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create dynamic project detail page</name>
  <files>src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create `src/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` as a server component (no "use client"):
    - Import projects from src/data/projects
    - Get project by matching params.id against project.id
    - If not found, call notFound() from next/navigation
    - Export generateStaticParams() returning all project ids (for static generation)
    - Export generateMetadata() returning title and description from project data

    Page layout (single column, max-w-4xl mx-auto, px-6 py-8):
    1. ProjectHero at top (full-width gradient, title, description, links)
    2. Tech Stack section: heading "Tech Stack", horizontal row of tech pills (same style as card but larger -- text-sm bg-white/10 rounded-full px-3 py-1)
    3. Metrics section: heading "Impact", grid of metric cards (bg-white/5 rounded-lg p-4) showing label and value
    4. ProjectGallery section
    5. CodeSnippet section with heading "Implementation Highlight"
    6. Year shown as subtle text (text-gray-500) near the top

    Style: Dark background matching site (bg-[#0a0a0a]), consistent text colors. Sections separated by py-12 spacing.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `cd /Users/jose/Developer/crativo.xyz && npm run build` -- build succeeds with static pages generated for all 15 projects. Visit localhost:3000, click a project card, see full detail page.</verify>
  <done>All 15 project detail pages render at /projects/{id} with hero, description, tech stack, links, metrics, gallery, and code snippet sections. Navigation from grid works. Back button returns to grid.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` succeeds with 15 static project pages generated
- Clicking any project card from the grid navigates to /projects/{id}
- Detail page shows all 7 sections: hero image, description, tech stack, links, metrics, gallery, code snippet
- Back button navigates to home page
- 404 page shown for invalid project IDs
- Layout is responsive (single column, readable on mobile through desktop)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Every project card links to a working detail page
- Detail page renders all required sections (PROJ-01 through PROJ-07)
- Pages are statically generated (visible in build output)
- Placeholder content demonstrates layout without real project data
- TypeScript compiles cleanly, production build passes
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-project-portfolio/02-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
