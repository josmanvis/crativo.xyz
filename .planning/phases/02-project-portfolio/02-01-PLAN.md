<objective>
Build the project showcase grid with placeholder data, category filtering, and hover animations.

Purpose: The portfolio grid is the core content visitors engage with after the intro animation. It must look impressive, filter smoothly, and invite clicks to detail pages.
Output: Typed project data, responsive card grid, category filter, hover effects -- all wired into the landing page.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create project type and placeholder data</name>
  <files>src/types/project.ts, src/data/projects.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create `src/types/project.ts` with a Project interface:
    - id: string
    - title: string
    - description: string (1-2 sentences)
    - category: string (one of: "Apps", "Libraries", "Experiments", "Tools", "Games")
    - techStack: string[] (2-4 technologies)
    - imageUrl: string (use placeholder like "/projects/{id}.jpg" -- will be placeholder gradient divs in cards)
    - href: string (link to detail page: "/projects/{id}")
    - year: number
    - metrics: { label: string; value: string }[] (e.g., [{label: "Users", value: "10K+"}])

    Create `src/data/projects.ts` exporting:
    - `projects`: Array of 15 placeholder projects spread across all 5 categories (3 per category). Use creative but realistic placeholder names (e.g., "Pulse", "NexFrame", "SynthWave"). Each has realistic-looking tech stacks.
    - `categories`: Array of category strings: ["All", "Apps", "Libraries", "Experiments", "Tools", "Games"]
  </action>
  <verify>TypeScript compiles: `cd /Users/jose/Developer/crativo.xyz && npx tsc --noEmit`</verify>
  <done>Project interface defined with all fields. 15 placeholder projects exist across 5 categories. Categories array exported.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build project cards, grid, and category filter components</name>
  <files>src/components/ProjectCard.tsx, src/components/ProjectGrid.tsx, src/components/CategoryFilter.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create `src/components/ProjectCard.tsx`:
    - Accepts Project as prop
    - Renders as a Link (next/link) wrapping a card div
    - Card shows: colored gradient placeholder (based on category) for image area, title (text-lg font-semibold), tech stack as small pills/tags (text-xs bg-white/10 rounded-full px-2 py-0.5)
    - Hover animation: scale(1.03) transform with shadow elevation increase, 200ms transition. Add a subtle border glow effect (ring-1 ring-white/10 on hover -> ring-white/30).
    - Dark card background: bg-white/5 with rounded-xl and overflow-hidden

    Create `src/components/ProjectGrid.tsx`:
    - Accepts `projects: Project[]` prop
    - Renders responsive CSS Grid: 1 col on mobile, 2 on md, 3 on lg
    - gap-6 between cards
    - Maps over projects rendering ProjectCard for each
    - Wraps in a container with max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6

    Create `src/components/CategoryFilter.tsx`:
    - Accepts `categories: string[]`, `active: string`, `onSelect: (cat: string) => void`
    - Renders horizontal scrollable row of buttons
    - Active button: bg-white text-black. Inactive: bg-white/10 text-white hover:bg-white/20
    - Buttons have rounded-full px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium styling
    - Transition on background/color changes (150ms)
  </action>
  <verify>`cd /Users/jose/Developer/crativo.xyz && npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors</verify>
  <done>Three components exist with proper TypeScript types, Tailwind styling, hover animations on cards, and active state on filter buttons.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Wire grid and filter into landing page</name>
  <files>src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Update `src/app/page.tsx` to replace the placeholder "Projects coming soon..." section:
    - Add state: `const [activeCategory, setActiveCategory] = useState("All")`
    - Import projects and categories from src/data/projects
    - Compute filtered projects: if "All", show all; otherwise filter by category
    - Replace the placeholder main content with:
      1. A header section: "crativo" as h1 (text-4xl font-bold), "Creative Software Portfolio" subtitle (text-gray-400), centered, with py-16
      2. CategoryFilter component below header
      3. ProjectGrid component with filtered projects, with py-8
    - Keep the RemotionIntro overlay logic exactly as-is (showIntro/fadeOut state machine)
    - Add "use client" directive (already present)
    - Ensure smooth category switch: add a transition wrapper or key-based re-render so the grid animates when filtering
  </action>
  <verify>Run `cd /Users/jose/Developer/crativo.xyz && npm run build` -- build succeeds. Then `npm run dev` and visit localhost:3000 -- after intro, grid of 15 project cards visible, filter buttons work.</verify>
  <done>Landing page shows intro animation, then reveals project grid with working category filter. Cards have hover effects. Filter updates grid immediately.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- Dev server shows 15 project cards in responsive grid after intro animation
- Clicking category buttons filters the grid immediately
- Hovering cards shows scale + glow animation
- Cards link to /projects/{id} (404 is fine -- detail pages come in Plan 02)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 15 placeholder projects displayed in responsive grid (1/2/3 cols by breakpoint)
- Category filter with "All" + 5 categories, active state clearly visible
- Card hover animation (scale + border glow) visible and smooth
- Grid updates immediately when category selected
- TypeScript compiles cleanly, build passes
</success_criteria>
