# Plan 03-01: About Section

**Phase:** 3 (About & Contact)
**Created:** 2026-01-24
**Requirements:** ABUT-01, ABUT-02, ABUT-03, ABUT-04

## Goal

Build a compelling About section that introduces the creator through bio text, technical skills showcase, profile image, and a visual career timeline.

## Requirements Coverage

- **ABUT-01**: About section displays bio describing background and experience
- **ABUT-02**: About section showcases technical skills and expertise areas
- **ABUT-03**: About section includes profile photo/avatar
- **ABUT-04**: About section features simple timeline of career journey

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create About Data Model

**File:** `src/types/about.ts`

Define types for:
- `Bio` (name, tagline, description)
- `Skill` (name, category, proficiency level)
- `TimelineEvent` (date, title, description, type)

### 2. Create About Data

**File:** `src/data/about.ts`

Placeholder data including:
- Bio text (name, tagline, 2-3 paragraph description)
- Skills organized by category (Languages, Frameworks, Tools, etc.)
- 4-6 timeline events (education, career milestones)

### 3. Build About Components

**Files:**
- `src/components/about/ProfileCard.tsx` - Profile photo, name, tagline
- `src/components/about/BioSection.tsx` - Bio text display
- `src/components/about/SkillsGrid.tsx` - Skills organized by category
- `src/components/about/Timeline.tsx` - Career journey timeline

**Design:**
- ProfileCard: Circular avatar, gradient border, centered layout
- BioSection: Typography hierarchy, readable line length
- SkillsGrid: Category headers, skill pills/badges with proficiency indicators
- Timeline: Vertical layout with date markers, event cards, connecting line

### 4. Create About Page

**File:** `src/app/about/page.tsx`

Server component that:
- Imports about data
- Composes all About components
- Applies consistent layout and spacing
- Uses semantic HTML structure

### 5. Add Navigation Link

**File:** `src/components/Navigation.tsx` (if exists) or create it

Add "About" link to site navigation pointing to `/about`

## Technical Decisions

- **Profile Image**: Use gradient placeholder initially (no real photo needed for v1)
- **Skills Display**: Badge/pill style with category grouping, optional proficiency bars
- **Timeline Layout**: Vertical with alternating sides optional, simple stacked for mobile-first
- **Component Pattern**: Follow existing atomic pattern (small components composed into page)
- **Styling**: Tailwind classes, consistent with project card design language
- **Data Layer**: Static data in src/data/, types in src/types/ (matches Phase 2 pattern)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `/about` route renders without errors
- [ ] Profile card displays placeholder image and bio tagline
- [ ] Bio section shows formatted text with proper typography
- [ ] Skills are grouped by category and displayed as badges/pills
- [ ] Timeline shows 4-6 events with dates and descriptions
- [ ] Page maintains visual consistency with existing project pages
- [ ] Navigation includes working link to About page

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 complete (Next.js scaffold)
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Existing component patterns established in Phase 2

## Estimated Complexity

**Medium** - New content type but follows established patterns from project cards and detail pages.
