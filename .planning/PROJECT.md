## What This Is

A cutting-edge portfolio website showcasing a decade of software projects (apps, libraries/packages) through immersive Remotion-powered animations. Features curated highlights with the ability to explore hundreds of projects through filtering and search.

## Core Value

Visitors should be immediately impressed by the presentation quality and understand the breadth and depth of creative technical work. The site itself is a demonstration of capability.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Full-screen Remotion-powered intro experience on landing page that transitions into portfolio
- [ ] Curated showcase of 10-20 best projects with impressive visual presentation
- [ ] Individual project pages featuring visual previews, descriptions, tech stacks, links, and impact/results
- [ ] About/Bio section presenting background, skills, and creative approach
- [ ] Contact/Connect section with multiple ways to reach out (email, GitHub, social profiles)
- [ ] Project filtering and search system for discovering work beyond curated highlights
- [ ] Bleeding-edge animations and interactions throughout the site (scrolling effects, transitions, micro-interactions)
- [ ] Responsive design that works beautifully on all devices
- [ ] Fast loading despite heavy animations (optimization required)

### Out of Scope

- Content management system — Static site for v1, real projects manually curated
- User accounts or authentication — This is a showcase, not an interactive app
- Blog or regular content updates — Focus exclusively on project portfolio
- Real-time features or backend services — Static site sufficient for portfolio needs
- Multi-language support — English only for v1

## Context

**Background:**
- First portfolio in 10 years
- Hundreds of projects accumulated over the past decade
- Projects primarily software apps and libraries/packages
- Need to showcase both technical skill and creative capability

**Approach:**
- Initial build uses placeholder/sample projects to demonstrate design and functionality
- Real project data will be added iteratively after core site is complete
- User will review and provide feedback, then help populate with actual projects

**Technical Environment:**
- Remotion available for video/animation generation
- No hosting or technical constraints
- Freedom to use cutting-edge web technologies

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: Ship fast — Prioritize getting something live quickly over perfection. Iterate based on feedback.
- **Tech Stack**: No constraints — Use whatever creates the most impressive result.
- **Content**: Placeholder projects acceptable initially — Real project data added during review/iteration phase.
- **Performance**: Must load quickly despite heavy animations — Optimization is critical to maintain impression.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Remotion for hero animations | User specifically requested "super impressive animations using remotion skills" - leverages React for motion graphics | — Pending |
| Full-screen immersive intro | Creates immediate impact, demonstrates technical capability before showing projects | — Pending |
| Curated highlights approach | Hundreds of projects would be overwhelming; better UX to feature best work prominently with discovery layer | — Pending |
| Static site architecture | No backend needed for portfolio; faster, cheaper, more reliable than dynamic site | — Pending |
| Placeholder content for v1 | Allows building complete site without waiting for real project data entry | — Pending |
