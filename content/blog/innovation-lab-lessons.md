# Lessons from Running an Innovation Lab

From 2018 to 2021, I led front-end development for the Innovation Lab at Retail Business Services (Ahold Delhaize). Here's what I learned about building experimental products.

## The Mission

Our job was to prototype and validate new ideas quickly. We built everything from kiosk software to internal tools to customer-facing apps.

## Key Lessons

### 1. Speed Over Perfection

In an innovation lab, shipping fast matters more than shipping perfect. We could always iterate.

### 2. Reusable Components Save Time

After our third project, we started building a component library. This cut development time significantly.

### 3. User Testing Early

We learned to put prototypes in front of users within the first week. Early feedback prevented wasted effort.

## Notable Projects

- **Stop & Shop Kiosk** - Touch-based shopping assistant with IBM Watson integration
- **Innovation Portal** - Internal platform for tracking innovation initiatives
- **NPM Packages** - Reusable tools published for the community

## The Tech Stack

We standardized on:
- React.js + TypeScript
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- Docker for deployment

## What I'd Do Differently

1. Document more—institutional knowledge walked out the door
2. Invest in automated testing earlier
3. Build better bridges to production teams
